My GraphQL projects and ideas.

## [CSP](./csp)
A Communicating Sequential Process implementation in pure JavaScript with 0 external dependencies. Usable in Browser, Node and Deno.

## [Remote Graph](./remote-graph)
A lib that lets you execute remote resovlers in a remote schema as if they are local. Useful for service oriented architecture.

## [Deno GraphQL](./deno-graphql-port)
Porting `graphql-js` to Deno runtime.
